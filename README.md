# Data Science Portfolio
My skill set focuses on transforming large amounts of data into meaningful and understandable insights. It excites me to tell stories through data that help companies make strategic decisions. By leveraging my business background, I am well-equipped to clearly communicate the results of data analysis to various stakeholders. 

Here is a repository of data science projects completed for academic and self-learning purposes. These projects are presented in the form of Jupyter Notebooks.

Tools: Python, Numpy, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Scipy, Scikit-Learn

## [Carvana Price Predictor](https://github.com/dylanjones248/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/main/Carvana%20Price%20Predictor.ipynb)

- Found relationship between the class of car brand, age, and mileage to build a model that predicts the car’s price
- Explored data using Pandas to understand the data types of each field as well as the number of null and unique values
- Cleaned data of several erroneous entries in the year column after determining appropriate approach to handling errors
- Designed visualizations with MatPlotLib and Seaborn to learn more about the relationships between each variable as well as show insights about the data set such the top 20 selling cars and the distributions of the numeric fields
- Manipulated dataframe to prepare for machine learning models by converting the name field into a binary variable
- Evaluated linear regression, random forest and XGBoost models based on the coefficient of determination and the mean absolute error to determine which machine learning model best predicted car price


## [Superstore Sales Dashboard](https://github.com/dylanjones248/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/main/Superstore%20Sales.ipynb)

- Explored and cleaned dataset of 9,800 sales from a superstore before creating a sales dashboard in Tableau
- Utilized Pandas to fill in null values, remove duplicates, update data types, modify formatting, and identify unique categorical values
- Created visuals with MatPlotLib to more easily identify abnormailities in the sales data

## [Sea Level Predictor](https://github.com/dylanjones248/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/main/Sea%20Level%20Predictor.ipynb)

- Produced visuals that show evidence of the increasing rate of change in sea level using linear regression 
- Analyzed over 120 years of sea level data to identify trends and present estimated sea levels in future years
- Charted scatter plot visualization with MatPlotLib of the actual sea level data along with two linear regression lines
- Modeled two linear regression lines using Scipy based on where the actual data diverges from the historical trend line
 

## [Website Page Views Analysis](https://github.com/dylanjones248/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/main/Website%20Page%20Views%20Analysis.ipynb)

- Showcased the website’s growth and lack of seasonality as well as highlighted ways the website can benefit from the data 
- Analyzed website page view data to identify trends and present insights regarding the performance of the website
- Cleaned data by removing extreme daily page view numbers so visualizations are easier to interpret
- Created several visuals using MatPlotLib and Seaborn to understand the website’s seasonality and page views over time
