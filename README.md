# Data Science Portfolio
My skill set focuses on transforming large amounts of data into meaningful and understandable insights. It excites me to tell stories through data, which help companies make strategic decisions. By leveraging my business background, I am well equiped to clearly communicate the results of data analysis to various stakeholders. 

Here is a repository of data science projects completed for academic and self-learning purposes. These projects are presented in the form of Jupyter Notebooks.

Tools: Python, Numpy, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Scipy, Scikit-learn

## [Carvana Price Predictor](https://github.com/dylanjones248/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/main/Carvana%20Price%20Predictor.ipynb)

- Import CSV file of Carvana car sale data
- Explore, clean, and manipulate data
- Display visuals of the data and their relationships to each other using matplotlib and seaborn
- Utilize scikit-learn libary to create car price predictor model
- Present observations and findings from the car price predictor model

## [Sea Level Predictor](https://github.com/dylanjones248/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/main/Sea%20Level%20Predictor.ipynb)

- Import CSV file of historical sea level data
- Create linear regression lines based on the historical data using scipy to predict the sea level in the future
- Utilize matplotlib to display the findings graphically
- Present write-up of the analysis 

## [Website Page Views Analysis](https://github.com/dylanjones248/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/main/Website%20Page%20Views%20Analysis.ipynb)

- Import CSV file of the page view data from a website over time
