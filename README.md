# Data Science Portfolio
My skill set focuses on transforming large amounts of data into meaningful and understandable insights. It excites me to tell stories through data, which help companies make strategic decisions. By leveraging my business background, I am well equiped to clearly communicate the results of data analysis to various stakeholders. 

Here is a repository of data science projects completed for academic and self-learning purposes. These projects are presented in the form of Jupyter Notebooks.

Tools: Python, Numpy, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Scipy

## [Carvana Price Predictor](https://github.com/dylanjones248/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/main/Carvana%20Price%20Predictor.ipynb)



## [Sea Level Predictor](https://github.com/dylanjones248/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/main/Sea%20Level%20Predictor.ipynb)

- Imports CSV file of historical sea level data
- Creates linear regression lines based on the historical data using scipy to predict the sea level in the future
- Utilizes matplotlib to display the findings graphically
- Presents write-up of the analysis 

## [Website Page Views Analysis](https://github.com/dylanjones248/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/main/Website%20Page%20Views%20Analysis.ipynb)

- Imports CSV file of the page view data from a website over time
- Cleans data by removing top and bottom 2.5% of data
- Displays page view data graphically utilizing matplotlib and seaborn
- Presents findings and provides recommendations of how to utilize and improve the data
